# Plane MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables LLMs to interact with [Plane.so](https://plane.so), allowing them to manage projects and issues through Plane's API. Using this server, LLMs like Claude can directly interact with your project management workflows while maintaining user control and security.

## Features

- List all projects in your Plane workspace
- Get detailed information about specific projects
- Create new issues with customizable properties
- List and filter issues from projects
- Get detailed information about specific issues
- Update existing issues with new information

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- A Plane.so API key
- A Plane.so workspace

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelvin6365/plane-mcp-server.git
cd plane-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Plane API credentials:

```
PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key_here
PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=your_workspace_slug_here
```

4. Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude for Desktop

1. Open your Claude for Desktop configuration file:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Plane MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/plane-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "your_plane_api_key_here",
        "PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "your_workspace_slug_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop

## Development

1. Install development dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
```

2. Start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

You can test the server using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

## Examples

Here are some example interactions you can try with Claude after setting up the Plane MCP server:

1. "Can you list all the projects in my Plane workspace?"
2. "Please create a new high-priority issue in the Marketing project titled 'Update social media strategy'"
3. "What are all the high-priority issues in the Development project?"
4. "Update issue #123 in the QA project to change its priority to urgent"

Claude will use the appropriate tools to interact with Plane while asking for your approval before creating or modifying any issues.

## Security Considerations

- The API key requires proper Plane permissions to function
- All operations that modify data require explicit user approval
- Environment variables should be properly secured
- API keys should never be committed to version control
